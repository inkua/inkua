# Repository Maintenance & Versioning

## Version 1.0
**Created:** January 2026

This repository serves as the central text-based administration system for InkuA.

## Versioning Strategy
Due to the nature of this repository (collaborative text-based administration), git history might not always reflect the semantic versioning of the content (e.g., file uploads, bulk updates).

To identify the "Last Version" or freshness of content:
1.  **Check Internal Dates:** Look for dates within the file content (e.g., in `LOG.md`, changelogs, or header sections).
2.  **Check CHANGELOG/LOG files:** Each space/project should have a `LOG.md` tracking major changes.
3.  **Git Commit Dates:** Use as a secondary fallback.

## Maintenance
- Ensure all Spaces follow the `templates/space-template` structure.
- Update `TODO.md` and `README.md` when completing administrative tasks.
