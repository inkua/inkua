# InkuA Repository README V1.0
InkuA Organization Main Repository

##  What is InkuA?
InkuA is a non-profit organization that provides the structure for virtual workspaces to develop or share skills while having a positive impact in the world.

As a virtual organization, we can quickly create teams to tackle any kind of challenge. With Github as a log, we are 100% transparent and anyone can create value for and change the organization. 

## What is this Repository?
This is the source of documentation, of our website, newsletter, social media, projects, meetings, workshops and members. 
Here you can track and present your or your team's contributions. 

It also tracks all interactions, and it's able to integrate with any AI to work as agents inside our organizational structure.

## Why this way?
You have everything you do, as an online CV and permanent proof of your level of contribution and engagement. You can discover other things going on, you can download, edit it, re-upload it, update it, discuss it, or just have fun. But it's yours.

You can also keep participating without engaging with the repository, but one of your directors will be updating your space, project or department here. 

By collaborating, every character you type will be stored forever publicly in our distributed Repository. 

Since the idea is to migrate the organization to this GIT repository. We have the advantage that all proposals, comments, and updates are all made public and shared with people following this repository. 

Everything - our Newsletter, Blog, Website, Projects, Roles, Discussions, everything goes here, and the documentation here is the most current one.

## How does it work?
Each directory has a README.md file that explains what the folder and files there contain, to work as a directroy for Humans and AI interacting with the organization. TODO.md files will be common. Meeting times and channels, projects, meembers and so on, should be inside a folder or "Space". 

We need to keep the project, roles, reports, tutorials, readmes and templates updated. We will try to use mostly text files in Markdown, json, csv, Fontmatter and other simple data types. But projects can include links to secure Google Drive folders, if members need to share or collaborate in presentations, confidencial or private infrmation.

## How can I get Started?
[./tutorials/] folder. 
- Github Tutorial.
- What is InkuA Repository
- Markdown tutorial
- Members list, Meetings, Minutes, Project Report
- Space Creation - SETUP.md 
- Publishing
- Collaborating with AI. 
- Creating Workshops.
- Starting Research. 
- Stay in the Loop (Read News and participate in Workshops.)

## Achievements:
- Run simulations of this virtual organization with AI agents collaborating with humans.  
- 

## Development Roadmap
We can integrate a simple python script with this repository that would load a compatible and small cpu based AI to answer questions about the organiation and repository, with a new version being able  to update and participate in the organization just by chatting with our Repository.

We will also use the markdown document content to publish that online with Nuxt.js and update the website. Most likely in a different repository to not mix administration and projects and main website/app coding. 


# TODO
- [x] Space/Department Template.
- [x] Developing projects\active\HR-Lab\README.md
- [x] Scaffold enough to make this AI ready and consistent.
- [x] Upload old projects.
- [x] We could create more empty projects/departments and populate them with example material.
