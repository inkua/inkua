# SPACE TEMPLATE

This is the basic file and folder structure all projects, departments, areas or teams should have. It's what we call an "InkuA Space"

# NEW HERE?
Go to the main REPOSITORY README [/README.md], for help and guidance. 

# STRUCTURE
The basic structure consists of:

SPACE NAME
./README.md         # Space description and status. Must include meeting and SETUP and Mission statement.
./LOG.md            # List all changes and updates, minutes, new members, structure or role change. Compact and "machine ready". 
./ROLES.md          # Roles, org chart, rotations and responsabilites & tasks description. Someone should be able to understand everything a role does in strategic or practical level. 
./PROJECT.md        # Document for specific tasks and if working also on a project, have the SPACE and Project tracking in the same place. No more than 1 active project recommended per SPACE. You can always create new spces with their own structure to collaborate with this space.
./ORGCHART.md       # Describes the position and roles of this space in the ORGANIZATION. Basically the "Big Picture" file. 
./SETUP.md          # Describes what the SPACE needs to operate, and a standard SETUP template and tools. 
./MEMBERS.md        # Lists current members and roles.
./TUTORIALS/        # (OPTIONAL) For any department specific knowledge and tasks.
./MATERIALS/        # Pictures, videos or whatever we can share on social media or to document the humans that make this SPACE.

## AGREEMENTS  
Leadership roles are rotatory. Everyone needs to take strategic decisions (Director/Coordinator) Manage content and members (Assistant Director/Coordinator) and managing the activities and members (Managers).

Remember meetings and changes go in LOG. If something is worth mentioning, can be logged in a NEWS document. But this needs checking.
