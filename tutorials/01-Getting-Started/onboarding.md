# Onboarding Tutorial: How to Contribute

Welcome! This guide will show you how to update files, add documents, or fix mistakes in the InkuA Repository.

**You do not need to be a programmer or know "code" to contribute.** If you can edit a document online, you can do this!

## What you need
1.  **A GitHub Account**: That's it. [Create one here](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one.

## How to Edit or Add Files (The Easy Way)

You can do everything directly in your web browser, just like using Google Docs or Word Online.

### 1. Find the file or folder
Click through the folders to find the document you want to edit.
*   **[`templates/space-template/`](../../templates/space-template/)**: If you are starting a new project or department, look here first.
*   **[`tutorials/`](../)**: Where guides like this one live.

### 2. Make your changes
*   **To Edit**: Click the file to open it, then look for the **Pencil icon** (✏️) in the top right. Click it to start typing.
*   **To Create a New File**: Go to the folder where you want the file, then click **"Add file"** > **"Create new file"** in the top right.

### 3. Save your work ("Commit changes")
When you are done typing:
1.  Scroll down to the box that says **"Commit changes"**.
2.  In the first box, write a short title describing what you did (e.g., "Updated the meeting notes").
3.  **Crucial Step**: Ensure the option **"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"** is selected.
4.  Click the green **"Propose changes"** button.

### 4. Send your changes for review ("Pull Request")
You will be taken to a new screen titled "Open a pull request".
1.  This is a request to merge your new version into the main project.
2.  Click the green **"Create pull request"** button.
3.  Done! A team member will check your work and approve it.
