# NOTEBOOK - INKUA

Here you can write down unorganized working data. 

I have several unconnected ideas that I want to write down sommewhere about how the organization work.

I'm going to jot it down here. 

# Important concepts for Spaces/Projects:
- Leadership roles Rotate every 2 to 4 months.
- Spaces need to have public meetings.
- Spaces need to update their documentation once a month.
- A director can ask a meeting for project or space status information.
- Spaces renovate every year but you can continue or re-invent them. 
- Go to SETUP.md file now! it explains what to do to help this space get started!
- Everyone can be a member and collaborate. 
- You can become 

You can log everything in LOG, meetings, role rotations, new members.
PROJECT.md is not redundant, is the "investigation part" The "current project" is always maintenience and growth of the space. But PROJECT.md assures the space has a consistent mission.


Need to set up meetings to teach and talk about this. 
1. What is this working on github - in text - with Google Drive links. 
Llms are good for one thing, generating and analizing text. That's why, our whole organization, activities, members, organization, projects, todo lists - everything will be here as text. In a structure designed for collaboration with Humans and AI.

> Maybe write this but without sounding like in a kaffeine induced trance or with help of AI. 

But with Github we can have the big picture and be part of it forever. We have the whole organization, all the information and knowledge, and how to keep building the organization foward. 

So all the concepts Area, Department, Project, Team - we make all the concepts into spaces. 

Members engage in Agreements that work for them with those spaces. 

We document everything in text, and hundreds or thousands of humand and mechanical eyes go through this information, offer support, value or just an interesting and resilient network where you create what you want.

Spaces can be "Meetup" groups, that just get together and talk or research about something. And in some formats, just fill a report every year. 

But that's the magic of spaces, they adapt to their members needs, no member does a task that they don't want to, or that does not produce value or they don't get enought recognition. Everything will be logged forever. Even if we had 1.000 departments with 10.000 members having meetings every day, we could fill this repository with all the text and summaries we want, it would all still fit inside a pendrive. 

Directors, co-Directors and Managers. Still work like they always did, the director creates the strategy, administration and networking for the spacce, co-director helps with the content and tracking of the Space, so assisting the Director, the Manager divides tasks and tracks members. In short. Everyone is working to create the best space were everyone in the team wants to do, doing what they really want and making it public. 

If the SPACE is growing, the PROJECT team can create it's own SPACE, with the original DIRECTOR listed as co-Founder of the new space in it's README. 

For spaces, in meeting minutes only list director and whoever is taking note as assistant. Put Director Name, Assistant Name, and 5 members. You are not forced to mention all members of the space, you are only required to have the Director and Assistant roles. 

Now that this repository works like this, we could talk and interact with it in natural language, like chatting with CHATGPT, but about the organization, and being able to make changes. 


We are taking some concepts from the original whitepaper, streamlining a lot of it.
