# SETUP FILE
Setup files are guides on what's needed for a space/project/department/area to function.

For example:
- InkuA Organization needs:
    1. Repository Manager/Director. 
    2. Communication channels. [Discord, Website, Emails] 
    3. Document structure. 
    4. Monthly Meeting. 

Note: Created in 27.01.2026, will need to be updated. But going to work in the real project SETUP file.
